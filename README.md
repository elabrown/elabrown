## Hi, I’m @elabrown ✨!

I'm a fifth-semester [EPD](http://berklee.edu/epd) / [GAIMS](https://college.berklee.edu/film-scoring/bachelor-of-music-in-game-and-interactive-media-scoring) major at Berklee College of Music, with a minors in [psychology](https://college.berklee.edu/minors/psychology). I'm interested in expanding the role of computer-assisted tools in music creation for video games, and developing technologies to enhance a composer's vision for interactive music. 

You can find some of my work and contact me at [elamorana.com](https://elamorana.com).
